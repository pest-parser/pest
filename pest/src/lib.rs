//! # pest. The Elegant Parser
//!
//! pest is a [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) parser built with
//! *simplicity* and *speed* in mind.
//!
//! ## Parser
//!
//! pest works mainly through a `trait`, `Parser`, which provides an interface to the parsing
//! functionality. Since `Parser` is a `trait`, parsing needs to be defined either though the
//! `#[derive(Parser)]` attribute, or manually through the [`Position API`](struct.Position.html).
//! The use of the `derive` is highly encouraged since this is the only way you can make use of
//! pest's PEG grammar, while manual parser definition can be used where highly specific or
//! efficient parsing is required.
//!
//! ## `#[derive(Parser)]`
//!
//! pest comes with a procedural macro crate--`pest_derive`--which needs to be included in
//! `Cargo.toml` in order to enable the `derive`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! pest_derive = "*"
//! ```
//!
//! ## `.pest` files
//!
//! Grammar definitions reside in custom `.pest` files located in the `src` directory. Their path is
//! relative to `src` and is specified between the `derive` attribute and an empty `struct` that
//! `Parser` will be derived on.
//!
//! Because of a limitation in procedural macros, there is no way for Cargo to know that a module
//! needs to be recompiled based on the file that the procedural macro is opening. This leads to the
//! case where modifying a `.pest` file without touching the file where the `derive` is does not
//! recompile it if it already has a working binary in the cache. To avoid this issue, the grammar
//! file can be included in a dummy `const` definition while debugging.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
//! const _GRAMMAR: &'static str = include_str!("path/to/my_grammar.pest"); // relative to this file
//!
//! #[derive(Parser)]
//! #[grammar = "path/to/my_grammar.pest"] // relative to src
//! struct MyParser;
//! ```
//!
//! The grammar of `.pest` files is documented in the
//! [`pest_derive` crate](https://docs.rs/pest_derive/#Grammar).
