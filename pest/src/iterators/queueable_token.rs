// This structure serves to improve performance over Token objects in two ways:
//
//   * it is smaller than a Token, leading to both less memory use when stored in the queue but also
//     increased speed when pushing to the queue
//   * it finds its pair in O(1) time instead of O(N), since pair positions are known at parse time
//     and can easily be stored instead of recomputed
